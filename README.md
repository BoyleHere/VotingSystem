## 📌 Objective

To design and develop a secure online voting system that ensures **confidentiality, integrity, authenticity**, and **accessibility** in the voting process. The system uses **cryptographic algorithms**, **multi-factor authentication**, and **blockchain technology** to protect all stages of the election lifecycle—from registration to result verification.

---

## 📦 Project Scope

- **Voter Registration & Authentication**: OTP + Aadhar verification
- **Vote Confidentiality**: End-to-end encryption using AES & SHA-256 hashing
- **Tamper-Proof Records**: Blockchain-backed vote storage
- **Fraud Prevention**: STRIDE threat modeling and secure web practices
- **Post-Voting Audits**: Blockchain-based vote tallying and verification

---

## 🔐 Core Security Features

### 1. Voter Authentication
- ✅ **Multi-factor Login**: Aadhar + OTP
- ✅ **Digest Functions**: Secure hashing for voter and vote data
- ✅ **Blockchain Access Control**: Immutable identity verification

### 2. Vote Confidentiality
- 🔒 **AES Encryption**: Encrypts vote data
- 🔒 **SHA-256**: Hashes for ensuring data integrity
- 🕵️ **Anonymity Guarantee**: Votes cannot be traced back to individuals

### 3. Data Integrity & Tamper Prevention
- 📊 **Blockchain Technology**: Stores each vote as a unique, verifiable block
- ⚠️ **STRIDE Threat Modeling**: Tackles spoofing, tampering, DoS, and more
- 🚫 **Tamper-Evident Systems**: Detects and prevents vote manipulation

### 4. Post-Voting Audits
- 🧮 **Transparent Tallying**: Cryptographic + blockchain-based count
- 🔍 **Audit Trail**: Detects duplicate or invalid votes
